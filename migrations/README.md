| `0014_payments.sql` | payments: reference, note, refund_reason (ADD COLUMN); triggers: frozen money fields, refund is final, no payment on cancelled/expired bookings — no data change |

## Commands

```bash
npm run db:migrate:local     # apply to local D1 (.wrangler/)
npm run db:seed:local        # DEV sample data — local only
npm run db:reset:local       # wipe local D1, migrate, seed
npm run db:migrate:remote    # production — take a backup first (below)
```

## Production rules (spec §53, §65)

- Never edit an applied migration. Every schema change is a **new** numbered file.
- Never change the production database without a migration file here.
- D1 refuses LIKE / GLOB patterns longer than **50 bytes** at run time (local SQLite does not): keep
  CHECK patterns short — `tests/db/schema.test.ts` fails on any longer pattern in the schema.
- Before any destructive migration (DROP, table rebuild, data rewrite): announce the risk,
  then back up and prepare a rollback:

  ```bash
  npx wrangler d1 export phasakura-db --remote --output backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M).sql
  # D1 Time Travel can also restore to a point in time:
  npx wrangler d1 time-travel info phasakura-db
  ```
- `seeds/dev.sql` is never applied remotely.
